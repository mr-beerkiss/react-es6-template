# React Template

## Overview

Some boilerplate code for React applications using ES6 and webpack

### Features

* ES6 support with Babel (easy to add ES7 support via `.babelrc`)
* Hot module loading
* Webpack dev server
* ESLint and CSSLint support

### TODO

* Add support for CSS preprocessors
* Add generic support for Flux architecture
* Production build tasks
* Improved support for Babel 6
* Unit testing support
* Code coverage tools
* Ideally configure template so that it can installed via Yeoman

## Running locally
